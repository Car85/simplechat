### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Car85/simplechat.git
    cd simplechat
    ```

2. Install dependencies & compile:

    ```sh
    mix deps.get
    mix deps.compile

    ```

## TODO

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements

- [ ] **Assign Random Colors to Users**: Assign a unique, random color to each user's username, which will be displayed consistently in both the message list and the user list.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Implement a dark mode theme with a toggle button to switch between light and dark modes.

### üõ†Ô∏è Additional Features

- [ ] **Emoji Support**: Add support for users to send and display emojis in their messages.
- [ ] **File Sharing**: Enable users to share files within the chat.
- [ ] **Private Messaging**: Implement private messaging between users.
- [ ] **Message Reactions**: Allow users to react to messages with emojis.
- [ ] **User Profiles**: Create user profiles with customizable avatars and statuses.
